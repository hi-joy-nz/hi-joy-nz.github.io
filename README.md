## Projects
### JoyBot (Python)
- JoyBot was my first large Discord bot, containing:
  - Legacy text-based commands
  - A spawn and collection system, where users spawn and collect a variety of over 200 unique spawns 
  - A truth or dare game
  - A fun fact command
  - A fishing command
  - A "who is most likely to" question command
  - A channel slowmode adjustment command
- JoyBot is hosted on my Raspberry Pi, and is currently used actively in a private server of nearly 50 members with frequent updates
- JoyBot is made with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

### SafeBot (Python)
- SafeBot was my first attempt to make a multipurpose slash-command based Discord bot, and is far more advanced than JoyBot, containing:
  - A complete slash-command and embed system
  - Error handling for all commands with developer logs for issues
  - A currency system
    - Users can earn and spend a currency from a balance stored in an external file
    - (Work in progress) Complete store and purchasing system with real-time store updates, with all store information stored in an external JSON file
  - A complete ticketing system
    - Users can create a private channel with staff, and are able to add extra users into the ticket
  - A user details command
    - Gets and sends data about a user from the Discord API
  - A Spotify search command
    - Searches Spotify's API for a term and provides details about the top result
  - Moderation commands
    - Mute, unmute, and slowmode control commands
- SafeBot is still being developed, and will be hosted on my Raspberry Pi for use in my public Discord server
- SafeBot is made with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
