# SafeBot Updates

## SafeBot Version 1.0.1 Release Notes
12th of November, 2024 • Joy
### New & updated features
- Added legendary/mythical filter to `/pokemon_collection`, so that you can filter your collection for your rarest Pokemon!
- Starboard now supports images and will show the *first image attached* to a starboarded message.
- `/work` will now auto-restart work after you claim it
- `/pokemon_info` now displays how many of that Pokemon you have caught. Thanks to `@eiranroan` for this suggestion!

### Spawn changes
- Enabled the Event spawn area: Discover the ancient world with the Fossilised Fortunes event spawns! If you're feeling lucky, shiny Pokemon are more likely to be found in the event area! [Read more about this event](https://hi-joy-nz.github.io/SafeBot/News#spawn-event-fossilised-fortunes).
- Jigglypuff no longer spawns in the Science Lab area, and Abra is now commonly found there instead!

### Bug fixes
- `/work` cooldown is now per-user, and not a global cooldown
- Other users are no longer able to use the page contol buttons on your `/pokemon_collection`
- The join "RAWR" will now only be triggered if the server joined is the Safe Haven server.
