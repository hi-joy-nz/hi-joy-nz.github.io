About user and about server command
> Pulls data from the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference) to provide information about a specified user or the server the command is used in. This does not provide any private or personal information.

Random colour generation
> Generates a random red, green, and blue value, then converts these values into a hexidecemal code. An image is then generated of the colour with the hex code overlayed.

Spotify Search
